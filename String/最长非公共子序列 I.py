521 Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

There are three cases  possible with string a and b:

Case I: a==b.
If both the strings are identical, it is obvious that no subsequence will be uncommon. Hence, return -1.

Case II:
length(a)=length(b) but a !=b.
â€‹Example: abc and abd. In this case we can consider any string i.e. abcabc or abdabd as a required subsequence, as out of these two strings one string will never be a subsequence of other string. Hence, return length(a)length(a) or length(b)length(b).

Case III:
 length(a)!=length(b)
 Example abcd and abc. In this case we can consider bigger string as a required subsequence because bigger string can't be a subsequence of smaller string. Hence, return max(length(a),length(b))max(length(a),length(b)).
